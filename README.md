# Task-Manager-App

This project is a practice application from an Angular course I am currently working on. The app is designed to help manage tasks and stores values in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Angular Components**: The project is built using Angular components, which are used to structure the application and manage its different parts.
- **Event Handling and Data Binding**: The app includes adding events with two-way data binding and uses event emitters for efficient communication between components.
- **Custom CSS**: The UI is styled using custom CSS to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
- **Data Handling**: The app practices passing variables up and down the component hierarchy, enabling dynamic and responsive data handling.
- **Browser Storage**: Task data is stored locally in the browser's storage, allowing users to maintain their tasks across sessions without the need for a backend.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` to start a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
